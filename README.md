An implementation of three board, x only, tic tac toe with Mis√®re rules built with JavaScript and JQuery.

At the start of the game players can play an x at any location on the three boards.

When three x's in a row are made on any board, that board is dead. The person who makes three x's in a row on the last board still active loses the game.
